# LeetCode 30 Day Challenge 2020
A collection of my submissions to the LeetCode 30 Day Challenge.

## Usage
The shell scripts compile.sh and run.sh exist for Linux users.

To run all tests, use the following:

`$ ./compile.sh && ./run.sh`

To run just some tests, add them as arguments after `run.sh`. For example, let's say I want to test Day 02, Day 07 three times, then Day 01. I'd use the following:

`$ ./compile.sh && ./run.sh 2 7 7 7 1`
